            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Full and True RELATION OF THE DEATH OF K. JAMES. Who Departed this Life, the 27th. of <hi>March.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS there is nothing ſo prevalent in the World, as Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Miſtakes, and Miſ-reports; and the Generality of Man-kind are but too apt, eſpecially in matters of the greateſt Moment, and relating to the greateſt Men, to be impoſed upon; whilſt the Truth of things done, if either Forreign or Remote, is always lyable to groſs Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57117:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 38 -->
and Errors and Abuſes in matters of moſt Importance; either by miſ-information or uncertainty, are daily induſtriouſly handed about, and alſo as fondly believed and ſwallowed; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing poſſibly ſo much controverted, or variouſly delivered, as the Actions, the Movements, and the Conducts, and all other Particulars (whether in their Lives or Deaths) as thoſe of Kings and Princes. For the Rectifying therefore of Faults of that kind, we think fit to Publiſh to the World, the full and true Relation of the Death of K. <hi>James,</hi> as we have received it from unqueſtion'd and undeniable Intelligence and Authority.</p>
            <p>The particular Engagement and Alliance of King <hi>James</hi> with the <hi>French King,</hi> being to the Wiſe and Judicious no matter of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty; we ſhall be ſhort therefore in that part of our Diſcourſe; reciting no more than what neceſſarily Introduces to the Narration of King <hi>James</hi> his Death. After the <hi>French</hi> Proviſions of Shipping and Men, for King <hi>James</hi> his Deſigns; and the great Hopes of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, that had been given him by the <hi>French King:</hi> to deal truly with the <hi>Monſieur,</hi> he began to falter in his Promiſes, and (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Intimate Correſpondence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) with very ſlow advances in the Affairs, he made many demurrs and delays; occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd however (as we may juſtly impute it) not altogether from his want of good Will to King <hi>James</hi>'s Cauſe, but rather from the Embarraſment and Encumbrance of his own Affairs at home, that indeed took up his whole care and Study. King <hi>James,</hi> to his no ſmall diſquiet and ſorrow, waited only the <hi>French</hi> King's leiſure; whilſt the Equipment of his Shipping (as he plainly diſcovered) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired more Speed, than the <hi>French</hi> King's faint and ſickly Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes could expedite; inſomuch, that truly, Dalliances and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at laſt, were all his Performance.</p>
            <p>The poor King, ſenſibly afflicted with his many Troubles, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the perplexity of his affairs; and finding too late, that his unhappy Alliances had only tended to his own Prejudice and Defeat, he began to entertain a very deep and radicated Melancholly. But, alas! poor Prince, he did not Live to ſee how all His Forces, Alds, Expectations, and truly his whole Meaſures dwindled to nothing. And the reſult of all is, that though he were a Wiſe Prince, yet Bleſſings did neither attend
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57117:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 38 -->
his Councils nor Actions: So that it is not Humane Wiſdom but Divine Direction, that orders and diſpoſes all to a good End.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, this aforeſaid Melancholy and Afflictions, all preſſing too heavy upon him, a Load too weighty for his Great Spirit to bear, his Greifs, Diſquiets, and the Reſt of his Reſentments no doubt not alittle contributing to His End, he fell Sick of an <hi>Ague,</hi> which afterwards turnd into a Feavour which was too Violent for him. During his Indiſpoſition and Sickneſs he was attended by thoſe Perſons of Quality and Gentlemen about him, who ſtill adhered to him; but nothing ſo exemplar and ſingular as His Darling the Duke of 
<hi>B—ks</hi> Aſſiduity, and Tenderneſs towards him. As the King had always treated that particular Favourit, with all the Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Gratious King, a Kind Friend and a tender Father; ſo there wanted not on His part, (how, Cordially we cannot ſay) all the Carreſſes, Application and Attendance as from a Creature, a Confident, and a Couneellor, due to the Obligations received from a King. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kings Diſtemper increaſing, and His viſible Diſſolution drawing nigh, he call'd for his Son, who riſing out of his Bed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before day, and preſenting himſelf before him the King rais'd himſelf up as if He meant to ſpeak to him; 'tis thought to leave ſome peculiar Commiſſion and charge with him: but <hi>His</hi> Spirits were ſo Faint, and Nature ſo Weak, and exhauſted in him, that he had not the ſtrength to Expreſs himſelf, but immediately ſinking down in his Bed, he dyed in his Arms, being Early in the Morning, the Twenty ſeventh of <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there not a Time and Period, prefixt to <hi>Earthly Things,</hi> and the all Diſpenſing Power, does either Infatuate or Eſtabliſh Councils. The King that was very much Impatient in His Health, was very Patient in His Sickneſs and Death; His Death being an Object of Univerſal Pity. But much more regretted of all Perſons, more nearly Related to Him, and Embarqed with Him.</p>
